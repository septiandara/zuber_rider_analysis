This report was prepared for Zuber, a ride-hailing app. The dataset pulls Chicago weather data in November 2017 from the website, and information from Zuber database on taxi rides in Chicago. The goal is to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

There are three datasets and HTML parsed database:

1. Information of the taxi company name and the number of rides each company has November 15-16, 2017;
2. Information on Chicago neighborhoods where rides ended, and the average number of rides that ended in each neighborhood in November 2017;
3. Information on the rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport; and
4. Information on weather records.
